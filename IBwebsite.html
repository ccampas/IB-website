		<p id="color"> The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19 for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu- ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. In the DP students develop skills from  ve ATL categories: thinking, research, social, self-management and communication. </p>
		<p> To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must choose at least one subject from  ve groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan- guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups 1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240 recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150 recommended teaching hours).</p>
		<p> In addition, three core elements, the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service, are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme. </p>
